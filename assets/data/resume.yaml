summary:
  - "As an AI engineer, I'm fascinated by the challenge of making sense of complex data. For over **5 years**, I've specialized in **NLP, Information Retrieval, Search and Recommendation**. My work has centered on creating intelligent, user-friendly solutions powered by **deep learning and LLMs**. I love turning a tricky problem/idea into a streamlined, effective application that just works."
  - "I seek to leverage deep learning and LLM expertise for impactful AI projects. You can explore some of my recent work, including an LLM-powered platform to enhance client support, in my work experience section."
  - "When I'm not immersed in the world of AI, you'll find me exploring the outdoors. I'm an avid hiker and photographer, often capturing the landscapes of the beautiful places I visit."
  - "And when I need to unwind my nerdiness, I do side projects. Check out some of my personal projects."
  - "I've also had the opportunity to publish some of my work, which still feels a little surreal to be honest. I'm not entirely sure how it happened, but you can check out my publications for a deeper look at the work I've been a part of."
  - "Wondering if I actually know what I'm doing? My experience and education are here to convince you (or at least try)."
