  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | 
      When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you'll find me exploring the outdoors or enjoying some friendly competition. I love hiking and trekking through the beautiful Saarland countryside – there's something truly refreshing about disconnecting and appreciating nature. I often bring my camera along to capture the scenery; photography is another passion of mine. I'm also a bit of a badminton enthusiast, and I always enjoy a good board game night with friends. It's the perfect way to unwind and socialize.

      Some other things I enjoy:
      - Gaming (cozy games and the occasional Valorant match when I'm feeling competitive)
      - Late night walks to clear my head and enjoy the quiet city
      - I also like to watch movies and TV shows
      - Trying new things and exploring different parts of landscapes - any recommendations are welcome! :) 
      - If I was not an engineer, I would be a professional photographer :)
